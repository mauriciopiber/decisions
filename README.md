# Decisions

This is a meta project about personal decisions and motivations in web development.

The idea of using only text archives is to keep it purest as possible from intrinsic dependencies.

There are a few a priory tools that we must keep on track:

You will notice the dialectical movement:

## Motivation

The main motivation of this work is to solve the problem of complexity of creating your own projects by your own. At the start of this idea, 2024, we're living the craziest time in history for web development, where there are new tools created every day to solve the same problems that other tools can already solve.

In this fight, we need to create our own projects and libraries based on other projects and libraries, and without a proper system of decisions it will be impossible to construct something, because you're going to split too much energy learning new tools that do the same thing.

So this major level of decision is the most important factor for now.

## Publicity

As for clients and society, it's important to share how those decisions are made and permit other people to judge and criticize your decisions is the shortest path to strengthen it.

## Contributions

The whole idea is to make it a public forum, where you can create issues and open pull requests to enhance discussions and make better decisions.

So you're welcome.

All discussions should be based on argumentation and evidences. We should compare everything in the most holistic way possible, with one helping each other to open their perceptions about all topics and the relation between them.

## Decisions of decisions (Meta)

1. Utilization of Markdown to write the README.md file of documentations itself.
1. ~~Utilization of plain text file to write the subsequent decisions.~~ - It makes sense to use Markdown for each decision point, because we're already using it for README.md itself.
1. There will be multiple levels of understanding, but we should start with the simplest form possible.
   1. The simplest form is X x Y axis. Where X will be the verticalization of the idea, for example, infrastructure, service, framework, testing and Y will be the horizontal of the idea, for example Svelte, React or Angular for frontend development.
1. The decisions will act like blocks. In the end of the way, the only matter is the decision, and the decision will be carried over the level until the top of the action.
1. It will be one folder for each vertical topic, with one single file with the discussion about the topic. The file will receive the name of the winner of the discussion.
1. We can have variables and circumstances, for example, choose Vercel instead of AWS due to price, and while getting a bit more money we can pick you AWS again, so we need to have the possibility of circumstances.
